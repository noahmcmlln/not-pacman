/*
  KEYED UP BALL
  KeyedUpBall is a "ball" (really, just a circle) that moves around a canvas in response to key presses from a user. It's a bit more complicated than that, but not by much. It uses p5.Vector objects as internal representation of position and direction, and a simple integer for speed. It also uses KeyListener objects to make it responsive.

  GENERAL USE:
  This is designed not as a general-purpose object, but it is a pattern that can be used for any number of moving objects. This is less a resuable object and more the sort of object pattern that will be very useful in future coding.

  SPECIFIC USE:
  Like most shapes, there are only really four things the outside world needs to know about:
  * The constructor, which takes an x and y for the starting position.
  * initialize(), which sets up the KeyListeners
  * display(), which of course draws the circle
  * update(), which updates state in response to any user actions
  * detectCollision(), which you have to write. See line 103.
